Excuses sound best to the person that's making them up, man stop bullish, stop bullish with me alright? Stop talking! Stop bullish! If you really got a problem with your life, you'll change it you're not tired of being broke, you're not tired of being stuck you're not tired of all the gun violence and drama and dysfunction around you, your not tired of being in an abusive relationship you're not tired because you were tired, you would actually do some shit about it you can't tell me you ain't tired anybody who is determined to do something, who wants something to be different , it eventually be different
